# Tyler J. Pike 

I am an aspiring econometrician and data scientist seeking to bridge the gap between economics and artificial intelligence. My research interests include machine learning for both forecasting and causal inference, quantitative finance (particularly asset pricing and financial conditions),  and the transmission channels between the financial sector, markets, and real economy. I am currently serving as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board in the Macro-Financial Analysis section of the Division of Monetary Affairs. I additionally serve as a research assistant for Vice Chair Clarida.

R Packages:  
1. [OOS](https://github.com/tylerJPike/OOS) for out-of-sample time series forecasting  [[Package website](https://tylerjpike.github.io/OOS/)]
2. [sovereign](https://github.com/tylerJPike/sovereign) for state-dependant empirical analysis
3. [treeImpulse](https://github.com/tylerJPike/treeImpulses) for tree-based impulse response functions

Research Code: 
1. "[Combining forecasts: Can machines beat the average?](https://github.com/tylerJPike/)" with Francisco Vazquez-Grande, September 2020
2. "[Bottom-up leading macroeconomic indicators: An application to non-financial corporate defaults using machine learning](https://github.com/tylerJPike/BottomUpMacroIndicators)" with   Horacio Sapriza, and Tom Zimmermann, September 2019
