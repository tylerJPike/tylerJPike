<span style="color:green"> Research Interests</span>
1. **Statistics and econometrics**: I am generally interested in how we extract information from data, with a particular focus on using non-linear and big data methods for causal inference.
2. **Macro-finance**: I am also interested in the way we as humans allocate resources (capital) across various economic activities, and the consequences of this allocation on production, inflation, and labor market outcomes.
